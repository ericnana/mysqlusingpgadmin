# Goals
The aim of this is to be able to use a script python to play with all what SQL has to offer like query data from table,
using SQL operators, managing views, tables so on and so forth,

# How to get there
I used pgadmin4 in this instance
Used as well the command line on my unix system
Create a Server directly from the GUI and afterwards created a database as well.
After these two ran the python scripts to perform all sort of queries needed.
